      "Understanding the Graph Introduction in Data Structures and Algorithms. As to what I have remembered. A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. Interconnected objects are represented as vertices by points, and edges are referred to as links connecting the vertices. In addition, A graph is also a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes. Let’s say for example in facebook, where everything there is a node. Because it includes User, Photo, Album, Event, Group, Page, Comment, Story, Video, Link, Note, timeline, and other important information that has data is called a node. Wherein Every relationship is an edge from one node to another. More precisely, a graph is a data structure that consists of a collection of vertices and a collection of edges, represented as ordered pairs of vertices.\n",

      "Getting to know the meaning of Binary Search and to how to apply it in data structures and algorithm. In my own understanding, Binary Search is a search for a sorted array by splitting the search interval into half again and again. Start with an interval that covers the entire array. If the value in the middle of the interval of the search key is less than the item, reduce the interval to the lower half. Narrow it to the top half otherwise. Check repeatedly to detect the value or to empty the interval. Binary search, which is also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is an algorithm in the field of computer science which finds the position of a target within a sorting table. Binary search compares the objective value to the middle array element.\n",

Step 4 - If both are matched, then display Given element is found nd terminate the function. Step 5 - If both are not matched, then check whether the search element is smaller or larger than the middle element. Step 6 - If the search element is smaller than middle element, repeat steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the left sublist of the middle element. Step 7 - If the search element is larger than middle element, repeat steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the right sublist of the middle element. Step 8 - Repeat the same process until we find the search element in the list or until sublist contains only one element. Step 9 - If that element also doesn't match with the search element, then display Element is not found in the list! and terminate the function.\n",

The idea behind bubble sort is that you're comparing two adjacent values with one other. If the value on the left is bigger, you swap it with the one on the right. You keep doing this for your entire dataset and your biggest value eventually bubbles up to the top. Lastly, Bubble sort is easy to implement and it is fast enough when you have small data sets.\n",

      "Understanding Shell Sort. Shell sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on insertion sort algorithm. This algorithm avoids large shifts as in case of insertion sort, if the smaller value is to the far right and has to be moved to the far left. This algorithm uses insertion sort on a widely spread elements, first to sort them and then sorts the less widely spaced elements. This spacing is termed as interval. This interval is calculated based on Knuth's formula. This algorithm is quite efficient for medium-sized data sets as its average and worst-case complexity of this algorithm depends on the gap sequence the best known is Ο(n), where n is the number of items.

The unique way that these sublists are chosen is the key to the shell sort. Shell sort uses an increment sequence h1, h2, h3… and this sequence will work as long as h1=1.

Elements are compared and exchanged depending on the condition and then selection position is shifted to the next position till it reaches to the end. Furthermore, when checking whether everything is already sorted, the selection sort can be good. It is also useful when there is limited memory space.

In my own understanding, a recursive function is a function defined in self-referential terms.

This is the recursive case: n!.\")\n",

In recursion, a function a is called either directly or b is called by a function called a. say for example, a function calling another function calling it again in return. Here’s another example of a recursive function to find the factorial of an integer. Factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 6 (denoted as 6!) is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720. Furthermore, I’ve also understand the advantage of using recursive functions in python. First, the code may be easier to write. Second, It is very useful in solving data structure problem. And third, it reduces unnecessary calling of function.\")\n",
